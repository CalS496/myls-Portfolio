# myls-Portfolio

myls-Portfolio is a repository that showcases the myls assignment from CS215 - Introduction to Operating Systems. This portfolio is for portfolio purposes, please do NOT reuse without permission.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

**Please note that included are different versions of the assignment for various stages of the assignment's completion. The final version is myls.c**

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

-Nothing else is needed to install the software! To get the source code, either clone the repository or directly take the raw file from the repository. 

## Deployment

To compile and create and output execution file:
                      gcc myls.c -o myls
To execute:
                     with verbose:
                               ./myls
                     without verbose:
                                ./myls -v

## Additional Notes

1.I've given reference to small pieces of code that I have reused from the internet in a comment line above where I used it. I wasn't sure if there was a proper form for doing this.


2.The redirection ">" feature in my program is a very simple version, that's what it seemed like you were looking for in the assignment details. It assumes that if there is redirection to be done, the next word following the character will always be the output file. I understand that redirection as a whole is a lot more complex than that.
